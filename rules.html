      <h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>

<p>The user has the ability to disable a rule/health check recommendation that they’re not interested
in to stop it from showing in OCM. The user also has the ability to re-enable the rule, in case they
later become interested in it, or in the case of an accidental disable, for example.</p>

<p>This is made possible by using these two endpoints:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clusters/{cluster}/rules/{rule_id}/disable</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clusters/{cluster}/rules/{rule_id}/enable</code></p>

<h2 id="tutorial-rule">Tutorial rule</h2>

<p>Directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rules/tutorial/</code> contains tutorial rule that is ‘hit’ by any cluster.</p>

<h2 id="rules-content">Rules content</h2>

<p>The generated cluster reports from Insights results contain three lists of rules that were either
<strong>skipped</strong> (because of missing requirements, etc.), <strong>passed</strong> (the rule got executed but no issue
was found), or <strong>hit</strong> (the rule got executed and found the issue it was looking for) by the
cluster, where each rule is represented as a dictionary containing identifying information about the
rule itself.</p>

<p>The <strong>hit</strong> rules are the rules that the customer is interested in and therefore the information
about them (their <strong>content</strong>) needs to be displayed in OCM. The content for the rules is present in
another repository, alongside the actual rule implementations, which is primarily maintained by the
support-facing team.
For that reason, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insights-results-aggregator</code> is setup in a way, that the content we’re
interested in is copied to the Docker image from the repository during image build and we have a
push webhook on master branch set up in that repository, signalling our app to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>This content is then processed upon application start-up, correctly parsed by the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code>
and saved into the database (see DB structure).</p>

<p>When a request for a cluster report comes from OCM, the report is parsed (TODO: parse reports only
once when consuming them) and content for all the hit rules is returned.</p>

<h3 id="local-environment-with-rules-content">Local environment with rules content</h3>

<p>The rules content parser is configured by default to expect the content in a root directory
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/rules-content</code>.
This can be changed either by an environment variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__CONTENT__PATH</code>
or by modifying the config file entry:</p>

<div class="language-toml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">[content]</span>
<span class="py">path</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"/rules-content"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the latest rules content locally, you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make rules_content</code>, which just runs the script
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update_rules_content.sh</code> mimicking the Dockerfile behavior (NOTE: you need to be in RH VPN to be
able to access that repository, but it is not private). The script copies the content into a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignored</code> folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rules-content</code>, so all that’s necessary is to change the expected path.</p>
